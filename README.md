##FYP project on Compressed sensing

#Background

Explores the use of compressed sensing in 2D-images. Using the concept of sparsity and Restricted Isometric property. Using discrete wavelet and discrete cosine transform to create the sparse signal, the sparse recovery contains LASSO and OMP algorithm to recovery the images.

The result shows that the image recovers with Peak-signal-noise ratio of 4.02 using 30% of the original data.

#Requirements

The algorithm was created using python and the following libraries are used: 
Numpy
Scipy
Sci-kit
Pywavelet
Sci-kit image 
PIL
